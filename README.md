# Artificial_Intelligence_codes
Codes for iterative deepening, 8 puzzle problem, A\*, Uniform cost search, A\* using different heuristics etc

Codes starting with q3* are from UCS, A\*, and applying heuristics in A\*
Remaining codes are solving 8 puzzle problem while maintaining fringe using tree search.
